Project that has GitHub actions to:
- build a CI/CD image
- Use CI/CD image to run terraform and generate terraform docs (and commit them? or push to confluence)

Terraform to deploy?
- s3 bucket and dynamo for state
- deploy eks cluster?

App in the same project to deploy via helm chart? Would be better with Pulumi though

# Install Terraform Docs
$ brew install terraform-docs

install pre-commit tool and use it to trigger terraform-docs (requires pip and python)

Ascii docs? ascii doctor and ascii doctor diagram


# Build image on M1 
docker buildx build --platform=linux/amd64 -t tooling_aws . --load
